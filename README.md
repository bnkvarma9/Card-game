7. Players can only drop card if they have a card matching the top card by the rank on them or color of them or if they have a wild card.
    Ex: If top card is "One of Blue", player can put any color card having "One" on them or any other "blue" card or any wild card(color change, +4).
8. After dropping a wild card that player decides the color that the next player needs to play, rank doesn't matter here.
9. If a reverse card is dropped, the direction of game changes.
    ex: If it is going by 1,2,3,4 order and 2 puts a reverse card then it changes to 1,4,3,2 and this continues until next reverse card is placed.
10. If a skip card is dropped, The turn of next player is skipped.
    Ex: If player 1 drops a skip and the order is 1,2,3,4 then, player 2 is skipped and player 3 has to play.
11. If a +2 card is dropped, the next player in the order takes in 2 cards from the deck and his turn gets skipped.
12. If a +4 card is dropped the player also has to choose a color of their choice for the game, 
    the next player in the order picks up 4 cards and their turn is skipped..
13. If a player enters 'q' when prompted they will be kicked out of the game and their score is invalid.
14. If a player finishes their deck first by dropping all their cards, they win..
    If 2 or more players receive same score, they are treated as winners..
    If all players have same score, it means game is tie for all the players...
